### Analyzing the Returns and Volatility of Varying Portfolio Allocations

This GitHub repository contains code and resources related to the analysis of portfolio allocations and their impact on returns and volatility. The project investigates optimal asset allocation strategies for retirement investment portfolios, taking into account risk tolerance and investment time horizon.

The analysis utilizes historical data from the S&P 500 Index for stocks and Morningstar's US Core Bond Index for bonds, spanning different time periods. Block bootstrap sampling is employed to capture the autocorrelation and dependence of asset returns.

The simulations explore various parameters, such as the investment period, rebalancing options, and rebalancing thresholds. The results demonstrate the relationship between portfolio allocations, returns, and volatility, emphasizing the significance of asset allocation in managing investment performance and risk.

The repository includes code for conducting the simulations and generating visualizations, as well as datasets used in the analysis. The findings provide valuable insights for investors seeking to optimize their retirement investment strategy and align their portfolios with their risk profiles and time horizons.

Please refer to the repository for more details and documentation on the analysis methodology and code implementation.
